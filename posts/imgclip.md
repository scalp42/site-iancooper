# Introducing imgclip

Starting from the code in [the post on accessing the clipboard through JavaScript](http://iancooper.name/clipboard-access-in-javascript), I created [**imgclip**](http://imgclip.iancooper.name/).  Paste an image into **imgclip**, and it will automatically upload the image to [imgur](http://imgur.com/) and redirect you to the uploaded image.

Of course, the image above was created with **imgclip**, too.
