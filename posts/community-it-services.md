# Community IT Services

With the beginning of 2013, I'm launching [Community Information Technology Services][http://www.communityits.com/].  I see a need in the local startup community for IT services.  Designing, building, and managing IT infrastructure&#151;especially for startups and small businesses&#151;is time-consuming and requires a certian level of expertise to avoid making decisions that will end up being costly in the future.

I chose the motto /taking care of IT/ because that's exactly what I do.
