# Community IT Services

With the beginning of 2013, I'm launching [Community Information Technology Services](http://www.communityits.com/).  I see a need in the local startup community for IT services.  Designing, building, and managing IT infrastructure&#151;especially for startups and small businesses&#151;is time-consuming and requires a certain level of expertise to avoid making decisions that will end up being costly in the future.  With over a decade of experience in the IT industry, I help my clients make informed design decisions and make sure that their infrastructure is configured according to industry best practices.
