# About This Site

This site is hosted by GitHub Pages.  It has no server-side code; everything is done on the client side.  I used CoffeeScript to write the client-side code and Less to help with the stylesheet.  The font, Source Sans Pro, comes from Google Web Fonts.  All of the posts are composed in Markdown and transformed into HTML on the client side using the PageDown converter.
